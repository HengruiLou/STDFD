> Abstract: With the rapid development of AIGC technologies, particularly diffusion models, the creation of highly realistic fake images that can deceive human visual perception has become possible. Consequently, various forgery identification techniques have been proposed to identify such fake content. However, existing detection approaches for AIGC-generated images remain superficial. They treat the generation process of fake images as an auxiliary tool for forgery identification or even regard it as a black-box operation, without deeply exploring the identification information from the perspective of the generative mechanism of fake data. In this paper, we propose Spatio-Temporal Distribution Fitting Deviation for AIGC Forgery Identification (STD-FD), which delves into the underlying mechanisms of the AIGC-generated process. By employing the step-by-step decomposition and reconstruction of data in generative diffusion models, initial exploratory experiments indicate that temporal distribution fitting deviations occur during the image reconstruction process. Thus, we model these deviations using reconstruction noise maps for each spatial semantic unit, derived from a super-resolution algorithm. Critical discriminant patterns, termed DFactors, are identified through the statistical modeling of these deviations. Ultimately, DFactors enhance the classifierâ€™s accuracy in identifying forged images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed STD-FD effectively captures distribution patterns in AIGC-generated data, exhibiting strong robustness and generalizability, and outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across major datasets in the field.
